# Numerical Methods

## Description

The aim of the Numerical Methods course is to present basics in numerical analysis and show how to proceed when choosing and applying numerical algorithms to certain computational problems.

## Project A

Creating a program that finds macheps in the MATLAB environment on a computer.

## Project B

Finding all zeros of the function:

f(x) = 0.3 * sin(x) - ln(x + 1)

in the interval [2,12] using:
* the Secant method
* the Newtonâ€™s method

## Project C

For given experimental measurements we are going to determine a polynomial function y = f(x) that best fits the experimental data by using the least-squares approximation.
