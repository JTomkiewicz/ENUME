# Description

The Numerical Methods course aimed to present the basics of numerical analysis and show how to proceed when choosing and applying numerical algorithms to some computational issues. 

It was by far the most challenging subject during my engineering studies, which took countless hours.

# Projects

- Project A - finding `machine epsilon` (upper bound on the relative approximation error due to rounding in floating-point arithmetic) in the MATLAB language

- Project B - finding `all zeros of the function` f(x) = 0.3 * sin(x) - ln(x + 1) in the interval using the Secant method and the Newtonâ€™s method

- Project C - determining for given experimental measurements a `polynomial function` y = f(x) that best fits the experimental data using the least-squares approximation

Each of the projects mentioned above includes a `comprehensive report` in PDF describing the issue and the used solution.
